Variable distributions

}


pick_new_song_from_cluster(){
  #sudo - subset data based on cluster and remove existing song -> then pick one of remaining songs.
}

#can look at following: cluster, centers, withins, size
#Could simply link each song to a cluster, pick nother song from that cluster based on a probabilty linked to popularity of the song and maybe an artist variables as well, as in pick same artist with higher prob if it is in the cluster
```
Let's look at the distributions of all the datapoints
