Variable distributions

  ggplot() +
  geom_density(aes(value)) +

#print(distributions) commented out because it takes forever to run

#print(ggpairs_1) see above

#Puts each song in  a cluster based on ALL numeric discriptors
cluster_1 <- clean_data %>%
  select(colnames(clean_data[15:27]), -TrackMode) %>%
  kmeans(50,100,1) # done some research and kmeans is apparently quite naive - working on
                   # an implementation with pam (and pamk). Also need to work on how we
                   # choose the number of clusters.

  rename_(cluster = "value")
tibbled <- tibble(clean_data, cluster_1$cluster)

```

    slice(row_number)

  return(cluster_number)
}

pick_new_song_from_cluster(){
  #sudo - subset data based on cluster and remove existing song -> then pick one of remaining songs.
}

#can look at following: cluster, centers, withins, size
#Could simply link each song to a cluster, pick nother song from that cluster based on a probabilty linked to popularity of the song and maybe an artist variables as well, as in pick same artist with higher prob if it is in the cluster
```
Let's look at the distributions of all the datapoints
