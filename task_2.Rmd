# expenential -0 is the maybe the way to go (scaled)
# database of thousands of songs - maybe be wary of outliers and such not
# simply twidderlerably parameters, raising questions so our model +how could we improve
# scaleability
# MEAN - PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION BUT LOSES ALOT OF DATAPOINTS. 
# WHY RATHER THAN ACTUAL METHOD, TALK ABOUT METHODOLOGY - MORE IMPORTANT
# think about aim of the recommendation - element of exploration - objective function
# WHAT WE FOUND OUT WHAT WE CONCLUDE AND WHAT WE RECOMMEND AND BUILD A REPORT ABOUT THAT AND SJUSTIFY WHAT WE HAVE DONE - WEEK 1 STAT INVESTICATION CYCLE
#can look at following: cluster, centers, withins, size
#Could simply link each song to a cluster, pick nother song from that cluster based on a probabilty linked to popularity of the song and maybe an artist variables as well, as in pick same artist with higher prob if it is in the cluster
