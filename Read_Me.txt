For this reason the .pdf has been included in the .zip file.
It is 47 pages long, with lots of graphs, so the key pages will be summarised below:

Page 12-13: function to redefine our popularity variable.
Page 13-14: new predictor variable summarising functions.
Page 14-15: The three dataset scenarios are defined.
Page 16-34: Best Subset Regression code, not our chosen model so not important.
Page 34-35: Ridge Regression
Page 36-37: Lasso
Page 37-38: Model summarisies and coefficients of best Lasso and Ridge Models.
Page 40-47: Implementation of Task 2
